@looski - Sorry to impose on you :p Change off anything you don't like.

1. camelCaseShallBeImplemented - no-more-hyphens_and_underscores
2. Commenting shall be simple - "// CAPS" for headings and sections, "// gen text" for gen fundaes - no need to put those lines since you can make sublime do that for you (use colour schemes \m/)
3. White space encouraged in the code. Anyway it'll be minified so no need to worry about saving space. So n white space :)
